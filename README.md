VR UTM Simulation

Overview:
VR UTM Simulation is a virtual reality project that simulates Unmanned Traffic Management (UTM) in a procedurally generated environment. It combines VR technology with realistic air traffic scenarios, offering an immersive and educational experience in drone management and airspace coordination.

Features:
- Procedurally generated UTM environment
- Hand tracking for natural interactions
- High-quality graphics with realistic effects
- Real-time traffic simulation with various UAVs
- Interactive scenarios for air traffic management
- Data visualization of flight paths and traffic density
- Voice command integration
- Multi-user collaboration in shared virtual airspaces

Installation:
1. Ensure you have a compatible VR headset
2. Clone the repository
3. Install dependencies
4. Build the project

Usage:
1. Set up your VR headset
2. Launch the application
3. Use hand gestures and voice commands to interact with the simulation
4. Explore different scenarios and manage the airspace
